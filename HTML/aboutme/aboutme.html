    <h2>Logan Davis</h2>
    <p>Hey there, my name is Logan Davis and I'm from Texas in the USA. 
        I'm a homebody and spend most of my free time indulging in my hobbies.</p>
    <p>I'm an avid reader and love nothing more than getting lost in a good book. 
        I'm also a massive Dungeons and Dragons fan and have played it for years. </p>
        
    <p>In my spare time, I like to create worlds and scenarios for my stories and watch my friends enjoy my epic adventures.</p>
    <p>And of course, I can't forget about video games! 
        I love to unwind by playing games on my console. 
        I'm also lucky to have two amazing sisters who keep me on my toes.</p>
