                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
                <p>
                    Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon River. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love 
                    with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river, and bear and bighorn sheep 
                    are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa 
                    pines which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun 
                    or rain when needed.

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <p>
                    Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green 
                    River flows towards the mighty Colorado River and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful 
                    desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash 
                    to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic 
                    formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days. Desolation Canyon has been recognized 
                    as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the granddaddy of all canyons and the granddaddy of all river trips. You will never forget 
                    your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly 
                    unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids but 
                    with side canyons and ancient Indian ruins accessible only by river.
